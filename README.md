# SIGEVO Summer School, 13 July to 21 July 2017, Berlin, Germany.

I was a part of the SIGEVO Summer School (S3), the first summer school organized by SIGEVO, ACM's chapter which deals with evolutionary computing. This was co-held with GECCO 2017. It was a great experience wherein we worked on different assignments floated by different researchers in this area. Link: http://gecco-2017.sigevo.org/index.html/Summer+School

This was the broader format of the school:
* **Day 1**:
Ten mentors will make a short self-contained lesson with several topics (connected or not between them). The expected duration will be 30m, plus 15m to present three scientific assignments to students. An assignment for a student could be of any of these three types: (1) make a written report, (2) program, (3) numerical study, involving a preliminary search in literature plus using a mentor’s own paper presented in past GECCO’s. These are just suggestions!

  Every mentor will also present one challenge for all students, consisting in attending to one concrete paper (or tutorial) presentation at this GECCO. Students are expected to make an answer to 8 mentor’s questions. The three students with more correct answers will win an award (500, 300, 150 euros) plus a diploma. Ties will be broken by those presenting more one-page summaries of (three) associated papers given by mentors.

* **Day 2 through Day 5**:
During the five days of GECCO, students will attend to the defined paper/tutorial presentations looking for an answer to the proposed mentor’s challenge. Students can prepare a sound summary of one page on the paper/tutorial for potential ties in the challenge. This is voluntary. Summaries do not replace correct answers to the challenge, but are just used for breaking ties on equal number of answers.

* **Day 6 and Day 7**:
We will here start a series of presentations (10 m presentation plus 5 m debate with mentors) of the assignments, where every student will summarize his/her work to the mentor panels. Mentors will grade students as they present, to give feedback to students and to allow the identification of the three best works.

I document here the material that was provided by the school and ones that I created during the course of the school.
